Mumble audio recorder
=====================

Description
-----------
* mumblerecbot.py is a mumble client application that connect to a server, waiting for enough users to be connected and then start to record.
  It also create Webvtt files to indicate events and speakers.
  to join the different streams when more than one user speak at the same time, it use a smal cython script for performance reasons
  I make it public, but it is a tailor made solution for my situation, and must be seen only as an example for using the
  pymumble module which is meant to be versatile 

* basicplayer is an exemple of a pymumble audio emitter.  It takes as parameter a wav file encoded in 16bit mono 48000Hz

Requirements/installation
-------------------------
You need the pymumble <https://github.com/Robert904/pymumble> module available (on your path or in a subdirectory)

It seems to work fine on Python 2.6 and 2.7.
I have used it on both Windows and Linux

for the mumblerecbotfast module, Cython is needed, at least 0.14, and you need a worinkg compiler environment (I use MINGW for windows)
there is a basic Makefile that should work inside the directory
